Dashboard Code Challenge
==============================

This project using Ionic (using HTML5 and AngularJS) as front-end framework and NodeJS as back-end framework (passportJS for authentication). 

## Using this project

To start the server:
Under the CodeChallengeYulong directory

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To start the client:
Under the CodeChallengeYulong directory

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```

## Memo

I'm not familiar with AngularJS, so I google search a light framework (ionic) and follow the instructions. To handle CORS issues, I refer to the http://blog.ionic.io/handling-cors-issues-in-ionic/ as solution. For the dashboard, I used angular-chart.js for convinence and mLab (Database-as-a-Service for MongoDB) as free cloud NoSQL database to store users' info. I used MEAN stack for this project and learned a lot about bitbucket.
